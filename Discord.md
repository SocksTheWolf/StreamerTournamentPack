# Intro

Absolutely clone the template, make your server a community server for extra functionality and automation purposes. 

Once all your teams have joined the discord server, close the server to new people by pausing the server invites. This will prevent raids.

# Suggested Server Rules

This was used for the FvF Tournament:

```
Couple of quick rules for everyone:

Treat others with kindness - This is an event for fun, friendly competition. You don't have to be friends with everyone in here, but please be civil.

No NSFW AT ALL

Please do not start any conversations regarding controversial topics. This is a server about throwing cards at other furry creatures. There's better places for this type of discourse.

Do not privately solicit other members of the server for commissions.

Realize that these rules may grow over time as necessary.

Violations of these rules may result in bans and/or expulsion from the tournament.
```

# Channel Overview:

* #game-rules post new updates to the current tournament rules in this channel. Pin your rules so they are easy to find
* #event-teams should be used to list the current team match ups
* #event-schedule should have the information for which teams are playing when. Use [HammerTime](https://hammertime.cyou/) to write magic markdown that will automatically post in people's timezones.
* #event-info should be an announcements channel. Any major updates should be posted there.
* #level-updates should be used to get people's current levels if they change since signing up. It's recommend that once you get any level updates, you shut down access to the channel
* #event-day-chat Use this to communicate with all the current players of the day, this is very good for getting people ready for the day with any information specific to them.
* #all-team-chat should be used to communicate to the upcoming teams as well as shoutcasters regarding coinflips, rules, decisions and other communication. It's heavily recommended to be used.
